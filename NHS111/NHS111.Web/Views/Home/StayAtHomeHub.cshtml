        Ask for a test to check if you have coronavirus
      </h2>
      <p>
        The test will show if you have the virus now.
      </p>
      <p>
        People in hospital, NHS staff and key workers are getting priority, but
        anyone with symptoms can apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can’t get a test straightaway you should try again later.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get the test by either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          going to a drive-through testing centre if you have a car (you can’t get a
          taxi)
        </li>
        <li>
          getting a home test kit sent to you
        </li>
      </ul>
