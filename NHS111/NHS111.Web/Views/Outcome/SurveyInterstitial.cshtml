        <h1>Thanks for agreeing to take our survey</h1>

        <p>
            Before you start, there are a few things you need to know:
        </p>

        <h2 class="nhsuk-u-font-size-24">If you need medical help call 111</h2>
        <p>
            Deaf people should use text relay to call 18001 111.
        </p>
        <p>
            We don’t monitor the survey every day, and won’t see comments you leave
            about your symptoms or if you ask for medical help.
        </p>

        <h2 class="nhsuk-u-font-size-24">We won't know who you are from your answers</h2>
        <p>
            Our survey asks you questions about using 111 online, and about what
            happened next. Everything you say is confidential.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you agree to do a follow-up survey we’ll ask for your email address.
            We won’t share your email address with anyone else.
        </p>

        <h2 class="nhsuk-u-font-size-24">We are responsible for your data</h2>
        <p>
            Our @Html.ActionLink("privacy policy", "Privacy", "Help", null, new { target = "_blank" }) explains how we keep your data safe. Survey data is securely stored by a company called Qualtrics, but we are responsible for what happens to it.
        </p>
