          Your symptoms suggest that you could have a coronavirus infection.

      <p>
        Do not leave your home if you have symptoms or live with someone who does.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is called self-isolation. Self-isolation is for people with symptoms.
        It is different to staying at home and social distancing, which is for
        everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are self-isolating, you must:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online,
          or ask someone else to drop them off at your home
        </li>
        <li>
          not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can use your garden, if you have one. Any exercise should be done at home.
      </p>
