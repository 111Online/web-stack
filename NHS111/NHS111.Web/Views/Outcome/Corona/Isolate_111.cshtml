        Tell 111 that you are calling about coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must tell them where you have travelled or about any contact you’ve
        had with someone with symptoms.

        If you hear a recorded message, make sure you select the option where
        you speak to someone.

        Although the risk to the UK public is low, it’s important to try to stop
        any possible spread of infection.
